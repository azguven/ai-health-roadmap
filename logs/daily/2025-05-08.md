## Day 01 â€“ Setup and Planning
Date: 2025-05-08  
Hours spent: 4  

### Tasks Completed
- Installed Anaconda + JupyterLab
- Created `medai` Python env
- Ran a notebook with sample dataset [test](../../notebooks/tutorials/test.ipynb)
- Set up GitHub repo and README
- Decided on folder structure
- Added a post-commit hook that auto logs into daily logs
- Logged what I found interseting from Kaggle Python in this notebook [Python](../../notebooks/tutorials/KagglePython.ipynb)

### Insights / Things I Learned
- Remember to make your hooks runnable with chmod
- Using notebooks for note taking on code blocks is much more effective than Obsidian.

### Questions / Friction
- Deciding on how to structure my folders and document my learning took most amount of time.

### Tomorrow's Plan
- Finish the Kaggle Panda course, take notes on it in this notebook: [Panda](../../notebooks/tutorials/KagglePandas.ipynb)

### Commits
**docs: add tutorial notebook with Python course notes** [`7b25e5e`](https://github.com/azguven/ai-health-roadmap/commit/7b25e5ecc3a745c20e3fff335ec2039de78a5e43)
