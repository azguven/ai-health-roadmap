## Day 02 – EDA Deep Dive, Git & Workflow Improvements  
Date: 2025-05-14  
Hours spent: ~8  

### Tasks Completed
- Finished the Kaggle Panda course, took notes on it in this notebook: [Pandas](../../notebooks/tutorials/KagglePandas.ipynb)
- Created exploratory data analysis notebook on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset: [Diabetes](../../notebooks/exploratory/PimaIndiansDiabetesDatabase.ipynb)
- Created a new [`general_tips.md`](../../notes/general_tips.md) file under `notes/` for various CLI, Git, and setup commands

### Insights / Things I Learned
- Violin plots are powerful tools for comparing group distributions and key statistical variables.
- Imputed features can become visually and statistically misleading — they need careful treatment
- `git rebase -i` is an incredibly useful tool for cleaning up commit history, even if `vim` is intimidating at first
- Choosing the right commit prefix (`docs:` vs `feat:`) depends on whether you're adding functionality or documentation
- I will be using the conventional git commit summaries. Might also use `data:`, `exp:` (for experiments) in addition.

### Questions / Friction
- Still unsure how best to handle heavily imputed features in modeling — drop, flag, or keep?

### Tomorrow's Plan
- Complete the Kaggle “Intro to Machine Learning” Course 
- Build My First ML Model on a Healthcare Dataset
