# AI in Healthcare – Mastery Roadmap

## Goal
Become proficient in building, deploying, and interpreting AI models for healthcare problems (imaging + clinical decision support) by Fall 2025.
I want to combine my clinical knowledge with techincal skills, in order to be the bridge between doctors and engineers in medical projects.

## Timeline
- Start Date: May-2025
- End Target: Nov-2025 (Phase 1–2)

## Learning Objectives (Current Phase)
- Python + Pandas proficiency
- Build basic ML models on structured health data
- Train and evaluate CNNs on image datasets
- Read and summarize foundational AI/ML research papers

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: all learning notebooks (exploratory, tutorials, experiments)
- `projects/`: standalone projects
- `logs/`: daily & weekly progress logs
- `resources/`: curated materials, reading notes
- `env/`: environment setup files

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [x] Phase 1 (May–Aug 2025): Practical ML/DL foundations
- [ ] Phase 2 (Aug–Dec 2025): Imaging, clinical data, projects, paper reading
- [ ] Phase 3 (Dec–May 2026): Capstone project + applications

## 📌 Highlighted Projects
- TBD — coming soon!
